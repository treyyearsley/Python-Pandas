# Overview
This is a data anaylysis program in wich I dive into data about college football bowl games from 1902-2022. I wrotr this program to practice and learn python pandas. I chode this data set becuase I really ejoy college football. This data set included all college football bowl games from 1902-2022. I fouces on bowl games that Oregon played in.

# Development Environment
For this program I used a kaggle notebook. I attempted to use Visual Studio Code and Jupyter notebook but had issues with downloads and accessing files. In Kaggle I used Python and imported pandas in order to analise the data. I also used matplotlib library to make a couple simple bar charts showing winner and loser points of bowl games tjat Oregon played in.

# Future Work
* I could dive into other teams and compare and constrat their stats to Oregon's.
* I could answer more questions about Oregon's bowl appearances such as how many time shave they made consecutive bowl games.
* I could import regular season data and look at Oregon's program as whole instead of just bowl games.
